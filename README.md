# Servet IV LanuzaSat
The [Servet project](https://servet.ibercivis.es/) allows people to create their own capsules of different weights which rise with helium balloons to around 35 km.

This repository contains the data extracted from the LanuzaSat capsule, which participated in the 400 gram category. It collected several different types of data. These are:
* Temperature (inside and outside of the capsule)
* Pressure
* Humidity
* GPS (latitude, longitude, altitude and time)
* Radioactivity (measured by an SBM-20 Geiger tube)
